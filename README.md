Help the frog cross the from the beach boardwalk to the ocean!  
-Use the arrow keys to move the frog in 4 directions.  
-Crabs walk left to right, gaurding the path to the ocean.  
-The beachball bounces off the sides of the screen and off of crabs. Don't get squished!  
-The seagull lets off a warning and then flies over from right to left. Watch out for it's shadow!  
-Reaching the ocean grants 10 points, collecting coins grants 5 points per coin.  
-Earn an extra life for every 50 points!  
-Obstacles speed up over time.  

Notes/To Fix:  
-On desktop I reccomend zooming the browser out so that the up/down arrow keys don't scroll the page.  
-On mobile tapping too fast can cause double tap to zoom the screen in/out annoyingly.
